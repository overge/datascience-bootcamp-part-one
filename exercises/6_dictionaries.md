Create a dictionary called `class_data` with the following keys:

- "course_name", which should correspond to "Intro to Python"

- "student_count", which should correspond to number of students, say 20

- "instructor", which should itself be a dictionary with the following keys
    - "name" ("Henry")
    - "gender" ("M")
    - "can_program" (True)

- get the student count from the dictionary

- get the instructor name from the dictionary

- delete the gender key under instructor

- change the instructor name to "Henry Xie"
